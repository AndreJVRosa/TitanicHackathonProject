# TitanicHackathonProject
Visual Novel Webpage game. https://titanic-hackathon-project.vercel.app/

The project was created for a Hackathon with a team of four. 
The theme of the challenge was Oscar-winning music, and we got My heart will go on by Celine Dion.
Our idea was to create a visual webpage novel where the player's choices had an influence on the ending of the journey.
This project was ambitious, considering the 24-hour time limit, but we created a complete and fun experience nonetheless.
We also created branches that don't have an ending for future expansion and more interlining storylines.
Overall, I'm proud of this project, where we used the newly acquired knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JS.
